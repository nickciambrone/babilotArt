          <p>
            My name is Callie Babilot and I am a 22 year old graphic designer
            based in Paramus, NJ. From a very young age, I became obsessed with
            creatively expressing myself through my artistic abilities. I picked
            up hobbies including drawing, painting, illustration, and
            photography which have happily brought me to where I am now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward years later, and the flow of artistry never stopped. I
            have now graduated from Stockton University with a Bachelor of Fine
            Arts Degree with a concentration in Visual Communications.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is nothing I love more than being outdoors or traveling
            somewhere outside of my usual surroundings. I tend to develop
            inspiration for art through my environment, the people I meet, and
            the things I love doing. Therefore, I tend to gain new perspectives
            on life every moment that I can, thus benefitting my career and
            passion for art.

        <h4>- MY INSPIRATION</h4>
        <div>
          While growing up in a household where art was greatly appreciated, I
          knew that I wanted to make the world a more colorful and creative
          place. Every piece tells a story, and a snippet from my journey as an
          artist. Come along with me as I explore my perspective of fine arts.
