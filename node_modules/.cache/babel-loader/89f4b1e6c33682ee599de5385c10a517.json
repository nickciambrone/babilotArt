Dani's fame picked up rapidly on TikTok, as she is known for her loud\n  voice, hilarious rants and booming personality.\n  She has so much character, so I wanted to portray that in the best way I can while\n  still making the logo simple. I presented the idea of having a lady's mouth wide\n  open with glossy lipstick, yelling some of Dani's infamous quotes from her rants.\n  She loved it!\n  What I like most about this design is the simplicity as well as the connection to\n  her brand. The design is easy to swap colors in and out of, making it a versatile\n  piece to put on apparel, business cards, etc.`},\n      {img:'danielle3.png '},\n      {img:'danielle2.jpg '},\n      {img:'magicallymaid3.png '},\n      {img:'brightside1.png ',\n    title:'The Brightside',\n    description:`The Bright Side Hypnotherapy and Meditation Center came to me to design their\n    very first logo for their company.\n    My clients wanted something simple, light, yet vibrant and positive-feeling.\n    People go to therapy for a plethora of different reasons, of course.
